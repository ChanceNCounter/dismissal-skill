Dismisses Mycroft

## About
There's no button on Linux, but who needs one? This skill teaches Mycroft a handful of dismissive terms, in case you should change your mind after speaking the wake word.

This skill includes a setting "verbal_feedback" which, if set to False, does exactly what it sounds like, enabling you to dismiss Mycroft silently. However, I have not yet implemented a way to *toggle* that value, so verbal feedback is always on.



## Examples
* "nevermind"
* "dismissed"
* "forget it"
* "go away"
